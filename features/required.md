We use `required` as one of the rarer [fakeywords](fakeywords) for targeting Swift.

- **Not** to be confused with the dependency loader framework called `require`

In Swift base classes can insist that any derived classes explicitly provide an implementation for a given function and mark it as required. 

Sempiler will allow you to use `required` in the return type annotation for a constructor or method.

Symbols are a crucial concept in the Sempiler project, where we focus on the semantics and APIs of the target platform rather than abstract them away.

Accordingly, symbols is a overarching term that can apply to the following contexts. 

## <a name="identifiers"></a>Identifiers

The standard use of symbols is for type, variable and function names. 

## <a name="stub-apis"></a>Stub APIs

A declarative (or 'stub') API is a mechanism for coding against native APIs that exist on the target platform. 

Read the dedicated [Stub API docs](stub-apis) for a deep dive on this topic.

## <a name="fakeywords"></a>Fakeywords

Fakeywords is the name of the mechanism sempiler uses to augment the lexicon of the source language, in order to represent concepts present in the target context.

Read the dedicated [Fakeywords docs](features/fakeywords) for a deep dive on this feature.
